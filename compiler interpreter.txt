Compiler takes entire program as input                       	Interpreter takes single instruction as input
Intermediate object code is generated	                        No Intermediate object code is generated
Conditional control statements execute faster	                Conditional control statements are slower
Memory Requirement is More	                                Memory Requirement is Less
Program need not be compiled every time	                        Every time program is converted
Errors after entire program	                                Errors per instruction
